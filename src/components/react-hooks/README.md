# First Talk in Js Meetup By Asim Dahal: State of React

- Talked about the react hooks
- Hook: A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. 

## Research or Learned React hooks

- useState() => to update the state, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. 
- useContext()= > to update the context
- useEffect() => to update the life cycle, The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components: Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate: , tell React that your component needs to do something after render

### Problems Solving Using hook:

- Wrapper hell => many div or html components to view 
- Huge Components => if we divide html components into React Conponent it produce the Huge components problem
- Confusing classes => confusion whether to use class component or just use the methods.
