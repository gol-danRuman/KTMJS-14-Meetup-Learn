## Research or Learned Chrome Extension

- Manifest
- Background Script => The background script is the extension's event handler;
- UI Elements => Extension UI pages, such as a popup, can contain ordinary HTML pages with JavaScript logic
- Content Script => The content script contains JavaScript that executes in the contexts of a page that has been loaded into the browser.
- Options Page => the options page enables customization of the extension. Options can be used to enable features and allow users to choose what functionality is relevant to their needs.

### Use extension by:
